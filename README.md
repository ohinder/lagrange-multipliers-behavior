# On the behavior of Lagrange multipliers in convex and non-convex infeasible interior point methods

This git repo contains code to allow one to replicate the results of the paper:

"On the behavior of Lagrange multipliers in convex and non-convex infeasible interior point methods. Gabriel Haeser, Oliver Hinder, Yinyu Ye. 2018."
The arxiv paper can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07327.pdf

Run "results/results.jl" and it will create the figures and tables in the folders inside the folders "results/figures" and "results/tables" respectively.

TODO:
- commit
- test file
- delete notebooks and clean up repo
- explain and check code matches paper (primal residuals)
- write README
