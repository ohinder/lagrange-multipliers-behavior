# On the behavior of Lagrange multipliers in convex and non-convex infeasible interior point methods

This git repo contains code to allow one to replicate the results of the paper:

"On the behavior of Lagrange multipliers in convex and non-convex infeasible interior point methods. Gabriel Haeser, Oliver Hinder, Yinyu Ye. 2018."
The arxiv paper can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07327.pdf

TODO:
- have a file that just creates all the results for the paper
- have notebooks where one can play around and observe the phenomena
- maximum dual multipliers
- condition on problems not having an interior, what is the dual multiplier distribution?
- write README
